<p>This JavaFX application uses WASD and space bar to color a window with (25x25) pixel squares with any color the user wishes to use. This application imports many packages such as the color picker JavaFX package letting the user pick from a pre made color wheel making the color option almost <i>'unlimited'.</i> The user also has the option to clear the canvas. This was coded as my <abbr>RST</abbr> for my grade 12<sup>th</sup> high school computer science class and such is quite <em>poorly</em> codded and I would like to go and make modifications to the source code to bring it to a more up to date state</p>
